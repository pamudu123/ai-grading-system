**Message from the Director General**


The National Institute of Education takes opportune steps from time to time for the

development of quality in education. Preparation of supplementary resource books for

respective subjects is one such initiative.


Supplementary resource books have been composed by a team of curriculum developers of

the National Institute of Education, subject experts from the national universities and

experienced teachers from the school system. Because these resource books have been written

so that they are in line with the G. C. E. (A/L) new syllabus implemented in 2017, students can

broaden their understanding of the subject matter by referring these books while teachers can

refer them in order to plan more effective learning teaching activities.


I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the staff members of the National Institute of Education
and external subject experts who made their academic contribution to make this material
available to you.

**Message from the Director**


Since 2017, a rationalized curriculum, which is an updated version of the previous curriculum is

in effect for the G.C.E (A/L) in the general education system of Sri Lanka. In this new curriculum

cycle, revisions were made in the subject content, mode of delivery and curricular materials of

the G.C.E. (A/L) Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Several alterations in the learning teaching

sequence were also made. A new Teachers’ Guide was introduced in place of the previous

Teacher’s Instruction Manual. In concurrence to that, certain changes in the learning teaching

methodology, evaluation and assessment are expected. The newly introduced Teachers’ Guide

provides learning outcomes, a guideline for teachers to mould the learning events, assessment

and evaluation.


When implementing the previous curricula, the use of internationally recognized standard

textbooks published in English was imperative for the Advanced Level science subjects.

Due to the contradictions of facts related to the subject matter between different textbooks

and inclusion of the content beyond the limits of the local curriculum, the usage of those

books was not convenient for both teachers and students. This book comes to you as an

attempt to overcome that issue.


As this book is available in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, the book offers students an

opportunity to refer the relevant subject content in their mother tongue as well as in English

within the limits of the local curriculum. It also provides both students and teachers a

source of reliable information expected by the curriculum instead of various information

gathered from the other sources.


This book authored by subject experts from the universities and experienced subject teachers

is presented to you followed by the approval of the Academic Affairs Board and the Council

of the National Institute of Education. Thus, it can be recommended as a material of high

standard.

##### **Introduction to physics**

If we go back to human history we can see that most discoveries which are useful to human
development are based on science, information networks, electric communication media which
spread around the world transformed the whole community as staying in a small village. Science
is the basis of all miracles in medicine and the development of modern technology. It is not an
exaggeration to say that discoveries in physics are conspicuous.


**Figure** .1.1- Electron microscope **Figure** 1.2- Hubble telescope


Physics is involved in constructing instruments from electron microscopes which can be used to
see viruses clearly, (for which light microscope with even a higher magnification cannot be used)
to the Hubble telescope, which can be used to see originating and diminishing stars at far distances
in the universe. These instruments help widen the vision range of humans.


**Figure** 1.3- Concord air plane

Because of the discoveries in physics, man who travelled by a cart at the very beginning developed
the transport facilities to travel by a concord air plane, which exceeds the speed of sound.

**Figure** 1.5- High pressure water jet

**Figure** 1.4- A photograph taken in the
dark by infrared rays


Physics is directly involved with constructing instruments such as infrared binoculars which are
used for far night vision and also high pressure water jets used to cut concrete.Physics is the
basis for discoveries that has led to the development of the stethoscope to modern medical
devices such as ultra sound scan, CT scan and MRI scan which are used for diagnosis in medicine.


The contribution of the discoveries of scientists in producing such excellent constructions should
be appreciated. In this connection more service has been renderd by scientists such as Galileo,
Newton, Robert Boyle, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.


Among the pioneer scientists who were responsible for important discoveries in the field of
physics by performing experiments in physics, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) can be the first to be
mentioned. He is the one who discovered the characteristic properties of the simple pendulum
which led to revolutionary changes in measuring time. The service done by him for the future
advancement of physics was more important because of the discoveries such as principles of
motion and Galilean telescope.


**Figure 1.6**     - Galileo Galilei **Figure 1.7** -Sir Isaac Newton


Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) can be introduced as a great scientist who contributed to a large
number of discoveries in physics. Among his discoveries, gravitation, basic concepts of calculus
which transformed mathematics in a new way and the discovery of the colour components of
sunlight can be considered to be important.

_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit 01**_
~~Robert Boyle (1627-1691) who also lived in this period of time did research relating to gases~~
and the basic discoveries that followed is more used in chemistry though outlined in the work of
physics.


Albert Einstein (1879-1955) produced the modern constructive concept of the special theory
of relativity which even changed the former accepted theories to explain day-to-day activities
and experiments in physics. In the twentieth century, he was awarded the Nobel prize for modern
mathematical physics and photoelectric effect.


**Figure 1.8** -Albert Einstein **Figure 1.9** -Stephen Hawking
Stephen Hawking clearly understood and managed to explain black holes that even most recent
astronomical scientists were unable to explain as a very high gravitational field, using physical and
mathematical principles and concepts.


Light and other electromagnetic waves were considered until recent times to be continuous flowing
of energy. A phenomenon like photoelectric effect cannot be explained using wave nature of light
only. As a solution for these problems, Max Planck (1854-1947) introduced the Quantum Theory.
According to his idea, when an electron falls from an outer orbit of an atom to an inner orbit, a
packet of energy is released as a quantum which is equal to the difference in energy between the
two levels.

~~Physics rapidly developed from various discoveries and theories presented by different scientists.~~
The basic foundation for these developments was the scientific method adopted for this.

It is important for a person who studies science to have an understanding about the scientific
method. Collecting information and knowledge through experiences in a formal way by observing
the nature can be considered a basic step. To explain those phenomena, hypotheses, principles
and laws have to be developed. Models are being prepared which can explain these hypotheses
and principles. To test the correctness of the models, formal experimental methods can be applied.
Predictions can be made by models using results obtained by experiments and according to the
progress or failure of them. Models are developed using new experiences. This continuous
development process is called the scientific method.

Measurements done using a correct approach is important in building most theories in physics.
As such, we can consider measurement to be the foundation of physics.

**Scientific methodology**
The steps of scientific methodology

  - Observation

  - Hypothesis

  - Experiment

  - Theory

  - Prediction

**Observation**
The first step in scientific method is to make careful observations to collect data. The data may
be drawn from a simple observation, or they may be obtained from experiments.


**Hypothesis**
From an analysis of these observations and experimental data, a model of nature is hypothesized.
The hypothesis is an assumption that is made in order to draw out and test its logical or empirical
consequences. We should be able to confirm it by testing. Testing of the hypothesis is called the
experiment.


**Experiment**
An experiment is a controlled procedure carried out to discover, test, or demonstrate something.
An experiment is performed to confirm that the hypothesis is valid. If the results of the experiment
do not support the hypothesis, the experimental procedure must be checked. If the procedure is
alternate and results still contradict the hypothesis, then the original hypothesis must be modified.
Another experiment is then designed to test the modified hypothesis.


**Theory**
If the experimental results confirm the hypothesis, the hypothesis becomes a new theory about
some specific aspect of nature, a scientifically acceptable general principle based on observed
facts.

**Prediction**
After a careful analysis of the new theory, a prediction about some unknown aspect of nature can
be made.

**Physical quantities and units**


A property which can be measured directly or indirectly, in a physical system can be expressed
as a physical quantity.
Example 1


Figure 2.1


Think about the description of a log of wood as shown in Figure 2.1. For this, physical quantities
such as its length, breadth, height, mass, volume and density can be considerd. Of these, length,
breadth and height can be measured directly whereas volume and density can be calculated.


Example 2
When describing the motion of a vehicle, quantities such as the distance travelled by the vehicle
in between two points, the time spent to travel that distance, speed or velocity of the vehicle and
acceleration can be used.


Measurements have a magnitude and a unit and sometimes a direction as well. “metre” is the
international unit for measuring length. Lengths have to be measured from a very small value to a
very large value. A tabulation is shown below, about several objects within that range of
measurement.

~~600,000~~ [ square metre of a black body at a temperature of freezing platinum under a pressure]

of 101, 325 newtons per metre.


Units which can be obtained using basic units are called derived SI units. SI unit of a derived
physical quantity can be obtained by using the definition of that physical quantity. In writing the
units, there should be a gap between the symbols of basic units. There should not be a dot or a
coma in between basic units. There are special names for some derived units, but those units can
also be expressed by SI base units.


Some derived units without special names are given in the following table.

If the value of a physical quantity is very small or very large it is not possible to write or read it as
it is. In such instances prefixes are used to indicate the multiples or submultiples of SI units. Name
and symbols of multiple factors of several prefixes are given in the following table.

Table 2.9-Names and symbols of multiple factors of several prefixes















**11**


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit 01**_

Rules to obey in writing SI units.

  - In writing base units, the unit should be written on the right side of the value and close to
it.

e.g. ten metres - 10 m

  - No plurals are used in writing SI units even if the value is greater than one.

e.g. five kilograms - 5 kg

  - In writing units as a product of base units there should be a single gap between base
units.

e.g. ten metres per second - 10 m s [-1]

  - In writing the value of a physical quantity with a prefix the symbol corresponding to the
prefix should be written in front of the SI unit symbol and there should not be a gap
between the two symbols.

e.g. millisecond - ms

  - In writing temperature in kelvin scale no need to put a small zero to indicate degrees.

e.g 303 kelvin - 303 K

_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit 01**_





**Dimensions**

In the system of SI units, mass, length, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, luminous
intensity and amount of substance are the basic units. Other quantities such as energy and
acceleration which can be derived using basic units are called derived units. Symbolic expressions
which show the relation of a physical quantity to basic units is called its dimension. In studying
mechanics and properties of matter, mostly used dimensions are mass M, length L, and time T.
Also there are dimensions for other quantities like temperature and electric current.

The way of finding the dimensions of several physical quantities we meet in mechanics are given
below.

Table 3.1 dimensions of several physical quantities





Quantities without units such as refractive index, coefficient of friction have no dimensions.
There are quantities with units but without dimensions.
e.g. plane angle and solid angle

Several uses of dimensions are given below;

1. To check the correctness of a given relation among physical quantities.

2. To derive a relation among physical quantities.

The following can be given as examples for the above.

**1. Checking the correctness of an equation using dimensions.**

How several physical quantities are related to one another is expressed mathematically by a
physical equation. If the equation is correct, the dimension of its both sides should be equal. If
the equation has several terms, the dimensions of all the separate terms should be the same.

If the equation connecting physical quantities _a, b, c, d_ and _e_ is,

_d_
_a_  _bc_ 
_e_

dimensions of _a_ = dimensions of _bc_ = dimensions of _[d]_

_e_

**13**


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit 01**_

**Worked examples**

If an object that travels along a straight line with an initial velocity _u_ and uniform acceleration _a_ for
a time _t_ and attains a final velocity _v_ and the displacement experienced by it is _s,_ equations
relating to its motion are given below.


(i) _v_  _u_  _at_



(ii)



_s_  _ut_  1 _at_ 2
~~2~~



(iii) _v_ 2  _u_ 2  2 _as_


 _v_  _u_ 
(iv) _s_   _t_

(i)   In the equation
_v_  _u_  _at_
dimension of [ _v_ ] = LT [-1]

[ _u_ ] = LT [-1]

[ _at_ ] = [LT [-2] ]  [T]
= LT [-1]

 dimensions of [ _v_ ] = [ _u_ ] =[ _at_ ]


Dimensions of both sides of the equation is the same and all terms have the same
dimensions.

 [ Equation (i) is dimensionally correct.]


(ii)  In the equation

_s_  _ut_  1 _at_ 2
~~2~~

dimensions of [ _s_ ] = L

[ _ut_ ] = [LT [-1] ]  [T]

[ _at_ _[2]_ ] = [LT [-2] ]  [T [2] ] = L

 [ dimensions of ]  _s_  _ut_  _at_ 2 


Dimensions of both sides of the equation are the same and all terms have the same
dimensions.
Equation (ii) is dimensionally correct.

_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit 01**_

(iii)     In the equation

_v_ 2  _u_ 2  2 _as_
dimensions of [ _v_ _[2]_ ] = [LT [-1] ] [2] = L [2] T [-2]

[ _u_ _[2]_ ] = [LT [-1] ] [2] = L [2] T [-2]

[ _as_ ] = [LT [-2] ]  L [2] T [-2]

 [ dimensions of ]  _v_ 2    _u_ 2    _as_ 


Dimension of both sides of the equation is the same and all terms have the
same dimensions.
 equation (iii) is dimensionally correct.
(iv) From the equation (iv)

 _v_  _u_ 
_s_   _t_
 ~~2~~ 

another important property of dimensional analysis can be introduced. If there is a
term in an equation expressing sum or difference, the two quantities in the term with
sum or difference should be of the same dimensions. i.e.

dimensions of [] _u_  _v_

dimensions of [s] = L

[] _vt_ and  _ut_ = [L **T** [-1] ]  [T]

= L
Dimensions of both side of the equation is the same and all terms have the same
dimensions.
equation (iv) is dimensionally correct.


**2. Derivation of equation by the method of dimensional analysis**

Suppose we want to develop an equation for the periodic time _T_ of a simple pendulum. First
we have to identify experimentally or logically the quantities related to the periodic time. Here
we can assume that the periodic time depends on the following quantities.

(i) Mass of the pendulum bob ( _m_ )

(ii) Length of the pendulum ( _l_ )

(iii) Gravitational acceleration ( _g_ )

Since we have no idea about the correct relation among the quantities we can write,

_T_  _m l gx y_ _z_ here _x, y_ and _z_ are real numbers

_T_  _k m l gx y_ _z_ where _k_ is the proportionality constant without a dimension.

T = MxLy(LT-2)z

The relation among quantities can be written as

_T_  _km l_ 0 12 _g_  12







_T_  _k_



The value of the constant _k_ cannot be found by dimensional analysis.


When a stone is tied to a string and it moves in a circle in a horizontal plane, we can assume that
the tension _F_ gained by the string depends on the mass _m_ of the stone, speed _v_ of the stone and
the radius _r_ of the circle in which it moves. Since we have no idea about the correct relation
among the quantities, we can write,

_F_  _m v rx_ _y_ _z_ where _x, y_ and _z_ are real numbers.

_F_  _k m v rx_ _y_ _z_ where _k_ is a proportionality constant without dimension.
Applying dimensions to both sides of the equation

Different tools are used to collect data in the field of science. Experiments should be done for the
verification of models built by organizing the collected data, and in the quantitative analysis main
activity is the measurement. There is a development of theories from measurements so obtained.
Several such instances can be introduced like this.


The solar system was found from the measurements of the position of planets taken over a long
period of time. Measurement of forces between masses is the reason for the total development
of the law of universal gravitation. Measurements about the motion of objects help the development
of mechanics. Measurement of force between charges, forces between currents and other
phenomena about electricity and magnetism is the reason for the development of electricity,
magnetism and electromagnetism.


It is clear that different measurements made according to the observed natural phenomena is the
reason for new discoveries and development of theories so formulated in physics.

**Measuring instruments**


**Working with errors (Working with uncertainties)**


**Systematic errors (systematic uncertainties)**
These occur due to faulty apparatus such as an incorrectly labelled scale, an incorrect zero mark
on a meter or a stopwatch running slowly. Repeating the measurement a number of times will
have no effect on this type of error and it may not even be suspected until the final result is
calculated. To eliminate this type of error, a correction can be introduced to the final reading. The
instrument can be recalibrated or replaced.


**Random errors (random uncertainties)**
The size of these errors depends on how well the experimenter can use the apparatus. The better
the experimenter, the smaller will be the random error reflected in an experiment. Making a
number of readings of a given quantity and taking an average will reduce the overall error.


The maximum error that can occur during a measurement is the least count of the scale. The size
of the error needs to be considered together with the size of the quantity which is being measured.
For example,

(208 1) mm is a fairly accurate measurement.
(2 1) mm is highly inaccurate.
In order to compare errors, use is made of absolute, fractional and percentage error.


For the reading (208 1) mm;
1 mm is the absolute error.
1/208 is the fractional error (= 0.0048).
0.48% is the percentage error.


As we usually require error to only one significant figure, the last two values given above would
be used as 0.005 and 0.5%, respectively.
The accuracy of a measurement is considered sufficient if the percentage error is 1 % or less than
1%. When we use a metre ruler for measuring a length of 100 mm, the percentage error is

1
~~100~~ [] 100  1% . Therefore, the accuracy provided by a meter ruler in measuring a length

which is les than 10 cm, is not sufficient. In such a case, a measuring instrument with a least count
less than 1mm should be used. For this, the instruments which use the principle of vernier or
screw are required. When calculating the value of a quantity _y_ given by _y = a_ _[n]_ _b_, the error of ‘ _a_ ’
influences much higher than the error of ‘ _b_ ’ towards the error of ‘ _y’._ Therefore, when measuring
a term which has been raised to some power, an additional care should be taken.



.



**18**


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit 01**_


When we calculate a final result like _y_  _a bn_, the error of the quantity “ _a”_ will have a greater
effect in the error in _y_ . Therefore, we have to take an extra care in measuring terms raised to
powers.

Various measuring instruments are used to measure various physical quantities. But here we
consider only the measuring instruments used to measure physical quantities such as length, mass
and time which are mostly used in mechanics.

A measuring instrument has a scale and there is a least count which can be obtained from that
scale. The instrument is not used to measure more accurate values than this least count. As an
example of a metre ruler calibrated in mm scale the least count is 1 mm. Because of this, we
cannot obtain an accuracy more than 1mm from a metre ruler. According to this, we can express
a measurement such as 17.3 cm or 17.4 cm but not as17.35 cm.


**Principle of vernier and vernier scale**

Scales which are constructed by dividing the range of certain number of divisions of a millimetre
scale into equal parts greater than that numbers of divisions are called Vernier scales. The
millimetre scale used is called the main scale.


**Figure** 4.1


The diagram shows a vernier scale constructed by dividng the range of 9 mm in a milli metre scale
into 10 equal parts. In the instrument with vernier scale, the vernier scale can be moved along the
main scale. When the instrument is adjusted so that the front ends of both scales coincide, then
the mark ‘0’ of the vernier scale should coincide with mark ‘0’ of the main scale and mark 10 of
the vernier scale coincide with mark 9 mm of the main scale. No other marks of the vernier scale
coincide with any other mark of the main scale.

To coincide mark 1 of the vernier scale with mark 1 of the main scale the distance which the
vernier scale should be pushed forward is the difference in length between one part of the vernier
scale and one part of the main scale. This length is called the least count of the vernier scale.

least count = length of one part of the main scale – length of one part of the vernier scale


According to this the least count of the above vernier scale can be found.



Length of one part of the main scale = 1 mm

When taking a measurement such as the thickness of a normal ruler (2 mm) using an instrument

with the above mentioned vernier scale, the percentage error is very large.

0.1
That percentage error  100 % = 5%
~~2~~

To minimize the percentage error of such a measurement we need vernier scales with other
fractions of millimetre. We know that Vernier scales can be constructed by dividing the range of
certain divisions of a linear scale into another equal divisions. But as the numbers of division are
large it is difficult to observe from the naked eye, which division of the vernier scale coincides
with a division of the main scale. Sometimes it is difficult to observe using a magnifying glass also.
Because of this, as a result of experiments done to obtain measurements like thickness of a
paper, the screw instruments were produced. The principle of screw instruments are discussed

later.


(a)
**Figure** 4.2 (b)


To measure the length _d_ of a rod using a vernier arrangement as shown in Figure 4.2 (a). one end4.2 (a), one end
of the rod should be kept coinciding with the first edge of the main scale and the vernier scale is
in contact with the other end of the rod as shown in the Figure 4.2 (b). The length _d_ of the rod is
equal to the distance moved by the first edge of the vernier scale. This distance is also equal to
the distance moved by the mark ‘0’ of the vernier scale. Therefore, the length of the rod can be
obtained from the reading corresponding to the mark ‘0’ of the vernier scale. Consider the way
of observing that reading.

The value of the main scale in front of the mark ‘0’ of the vernier scale is 1.1 cm, which is the
reading of the main scale. The distance between this reading and mark ‘0’ of the vernier scale
should be read by the vernier scale. We know that the distance through which the vernier scale
should be moved to coincide first mark of the vernier scale with first mark of the main scale is 1
least count. To coincide the 2 [nd] mark of the vernier scale with the 2 [nd] mark of the main scale, the
distance through which the vernier scale should be moved is 2  least count. Here the 4 [th] mark

of vernier coincides with a mark of the main scale (Figure 4.2 (b)) and hence the distanceof vernier coincides with a mark of the main scale. (Figure 4.2 (b)) and hence the distance

moved by the vernier scale is 4  least count = 4×0.1=0.4 mm . Therefore, the reading given
by the vernier scale is 0.04 cm.
 _d_ = (1.1 + 0.04) = 1.14 cm

The length can be measured accurately up to [1 ][ cm = 0.01 cm] using this vernier scale.

**Figure** 4.3 - Vernier calipers


Figure 4.3 shows vernier calipers constructed using a similar vernier scale. It consists of a fixed
jaw attached to a main scale calibrated in mm and a movable jaw attached to a vernier scale
which can slide along the main scale. A rod is also attached to the vernier scale. External jaws can
be used to measure external diameter of a cylinder, internal jaws can be used to measure internal
diameter of a hollow cylinder and the rod can be used to measure the depth of a hole. By rotating
the wheel, vernier scale with the movable jaws can be moved to and fro along the main scale and
by tightening the nut, vernier scale can be kept in a fixed position before taking a reading.


Vernier calipers mostly used in laboratories for experimental work, have a main scale calibrated
in mm and the vernier scale is marked by dividing the 9 mm range of the main scale into 10 equal
parts. According to this the least count of the vernier calipers is 0.1 mm or 0.01 cm.


_**Zero error**_
When the vernier scale of the vernier calipers is adjusted such that the jaws are in contact with
the zero mark of the vernier scale should coincide with the zero mark of the main scale. But in
some vernier calipers of the above type, due to some reasons such as corrosion or wasted jaws,
the zero mark of the vernier scale lies to the right side or to the left side of the main scale zero
mark. Because of this there is an error in the instrument. This error is called the zero error of the
vernier calipers.

Example 1



**Figure** 4.4



When the jaws of the vernier calipers are in contact, suppose that the 2 [nd] mark of the vernier
scale coincides with a mark of the main scale as shown in the Figure 4.4 (a). Then the reading
indicated by the vernier scale is 3 0.1 mm . Because of this, the zero error is denoted by
+0.3 mm. When there is a zero error, reading of the measurement obtained by the instrument is
incorrect. The reading obtained from the vernier calipers indicated in the Figure 4.4(a) is more
than the true value. To obtain the true value if the zero error is positive, zero correction is
negative. That is, for the correction, zero error should be deducted from the relevant reading.


Example 2
The reading obtained from the vernier calipers indicated in the Figure 4.4 (b) is less than the true
value. If the zero of the vernier is moved to the left side of the zero of the main scale, zero error
is a negative number and for the correction, this value should be added to the relevant reading.
Because of this, the zero correction is a positive number. Therefore, the magnitude of zero error
of the vernier calipers indicated in Figure 4.4 (b) is;

7 × 0.9 mm - 6 × 1 mm = 6.3 - 6 mm = 0.3 mm 


Whether the zero error is positive or negative is not an important issue. Now the concept of
positive and negative is hardly in use. When the vernier scale is adjusted so that the jaws of the
vernier calipers are in contact and if the zero mark of the vernier scale lies to the right side of the
zero mark of the main scale, the zero error should be deducted from the relevant reading. If the
zero mark of the vernier scale lies to the left side of the zero mark of the main scale, the zero error
should be added to the relevant reading.

Vernier scales with least counts smaller than 0.1 mm is used to measure very small lengths. In the
travelling microscope the main scale is divided upto 0.5 mm parts. Vernier scale is formed by
dividing the range of 49 parts of the main divisions into 50 equal parts. Consider the way of
calculating the least count of this vernier.

**Figure** 4.5-Travelling microscope



The travelling microscope is shown in Figure 4.5 and its main parts are named. It consists of a
base with a main scale calibrated in 0.5 mm divisions and a vertical scale calibrated in 0.5 mm
parts attached to a platform with a vernier scale which can move up and down along the vertical
scale. A small microscope is attached to this platform and the microscope can be fixed in a
horizontal or vertical position according to the needs.

By moving the horizontal platform along the horizontal scale microscope can be moved horizontally
and the horizontal distance moved can be obtained from the horizontal scale. By moving the
vertical platform up and down along the vertical scale the microscope can be moved vertically
and the vertical distance moved can be obtained from the vertical scale.

Tiny movements along the vertical scale can be done by the screw C1and tiny movements along
horizontal scale can be done by the screw C2. Before using the instrument the base should be
levelled horizontally and that can be done by using the levelling screws A1 and A . 2 Miscroscope
can be focused on the object of which a measurement has to be taken, by adjusting the screw
D. The least count of the vertical scale of travelling microscope is 0.01 mm as mentioned above.
Vernier division which coincides with a scale division cannot be read from the naked eye.
Therefore, a magnifying glass is used.

Travelling microscope is used to obtain measurements such as the length of a mercury thread
inserted in a capillary tube, horizontal and vertical diameters of a capillary tube base, real and
apparent depth of a mark when viewed through a glass block etc.

Extended vernier scale is designed to obtain very small measurements and an easily readable
vernier scale with gaps of calibration not so close to each other. In such verniers the number of
vernier divisions is 20. The 20 divisions include 39 mm of the main scale. The least count of the
vernier is the difference between two divisions of the main scale and one division of the vernier
scale. Consider the method of calculating the least count of this vernier.

~~**Screw principle**~~

A measurement like the thickness of a paper cannot be measured by vernier calipers which are in
common use. As a result for experiments on these measurements screw instruments are produced.
Screw instruments consist of a fine thread screw which can pass through a nut. When the screw

is rotated one revolution it moves to a distance equal to the gap between two consecutiveis rotated one revolution. it moves to a distance equal to the gap between two consecutive

threads. This is called as the pitch (screw gap) of the screw.


Circumference of the screw head is divided into
equal parts and the distance moved by the screw
forward or backward can be obtained from a
linear scale calibrated in 0.5 mm parts attached
to the nut.

Micrometer screw gauge is shown in the Figure 4.9 and its main parts are named. Anvil is
attached to the end of a frame which is connected to a nut . The spindle is connected to a screw
with fine threads passing through the nut. Main (linear) scale is calibrated on the sleeve attached
to the nut and the screw can move on the sleeve while rotating. The thimble head is connected to
the screw. By rotating the thimble head, the thimble can be moved along the main scale. At the
end of the thimble there is a circular scale.

The pitch of a micrometer screw gauge is 0.5 mm and the circular scale is divided into 50 equal
parts. By rotating one division of the circular scale the distance moved by the screw is the least
count. While rotating by holding from thimble head, when the spindle just touches the anvil or
when the spindle and anvil just touch an object kept between them, the thimble head freely rotate
emitting a sound due to a mechanism inside it. This avoids unnecessary pressing on the measuring
object by spindle and anvil. Before taking the reading the spindle can be kept in a fixed position
by the locking lever.

**Figure** 4.10

When it is rotated by holding from the thimble head so that the spindle just touches the anvil, the
zero of the circular scale should coincide with the main scale line as shown in the Figure 4.10 (a).
But in some screw gauges due to some reasons such as corrotion or waste of the spindle and
anvil, when the thimble head is rotated so that the spindle just touches the anvil, the zero of the
circular scale is in a position as indicated in the Figure 4.10 (b) and Figure 4.10 (c). Because of
this, an error will occur . This error is called the zero error of the screw gauge.

According to Figure 4.10 (b) the reading of the circular scale starts from the 2 [nd] division, that is
0.02 mm. Therefore, the zero error is 0.02 mm and for the correction this value should be
deducted from the relevant reading.

According to Figure 4.10 (c) the zero of the circular scale coincides with the main scale line only
when four divisions of the circular scale is rotated. That is, 0.04 mm is rotated. Therefore, the
zero error is 0.04 mm. When taking the reading, since the values are counted from zero of the
circular scale, the above value is not included in the reading obtained. Therefore, for the correction,
the zero error should be added to the relevant reading. Micrometer screw gauge is used to
obtain measurements such as thickness of a paper, diameter of a small bicycle ball bearing,
diameter of a thin wire or thickness of a blade.

~~Spherometer is another important measuring instrument which uses the screw principle. Since~~
this is used to measure the thickness of a cover slip or a microscopic slide as well as to take
measurements needed to calculate the radius of curvature of a spherical surface (convex and
concave), it is called a spherometer.

Spherometer consists of three equal legs with their points situated at the vertices of an equilateral
triangle and a screw with fine threads and a point passing through a nut situated at the centre of
a circle passing through the three legs. Main scale is attached vertically to one leg of the instrument
and the circular scale is attached to the head of the screw. Since the main scale is a centre zero
scale, movement of the screw pointer above or below the plane passing through the pointers of
the legs can be read.

The main scale (vertical scale) of the spherometer which is mostly in use is calibrated in 0.5 mm
parts and the circular scale is divided into 50 equal parts. Its pitch is 0.5 mm.

One vernier division = 0.01 mm

Least count = 0.01 mm

When using the spherometer first we have to keep the points of the three legs to touch the
supplied optically flat glass surface and rotate the screw head so that the screw point just
touches the glass surface. In that instant the zero of the circular scale of instrument without
defect, will lie along the main scale.

If it is not, the circular scale indicates a non-reading reading. That reading is the zero error. The
correction can be positive or negative according to whether the initial reading of the spherometer
is above or below the foot plane and also whether the reading is taken using a convex or
concave surface. In finding the radius of curvature of a spherical surface, if the distance in which
the screw pointer is raised up ( or moved down) from the foot plane is _h_, the gap between the
points of two legs of the spherometer is ‘ _a_ ’ and the radius of curvature of the spherical surface
is ‘ _R_ ’ then,

~~**Measurement of time**~~

Time spent for a certain incident can be measured upto one second using a normal clock or a
wrist watch, which cannot be used to measure a fraction of a second. For measurements such as
the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum, or the time spent for a short distance running
event, stop watch is used from which a fraction of a second can be measured.


**Figure** 4.12
(a) (b)

A stop clock which is used to measure short time range is shown in the Figure 4.13 (a). It can be
started by pushing the leaver A downwards, and by pushing the leaver upwards it can be stopped.
By pushing the leaver B downwards the indicator can be brought to the initial zero position. An
electron stop watch used to measure short time ranges is shown in Figure 4.13 (b). It can be
started by pressing the button C and can be stopped by pressing the same button again. By
pressing the button D the indicator numbers can be brought back to the initial zero value. Time
can be measured upto 0.1 second using this stop watch.


When measuring time using instruments like this, the accuracy of the measurement depends on
the reaction time of the person who operates the instrument.The reaction time of a person is the
time range between the observation of some incident and responding to it.

A triple beam balance is shown in Figure 4.14 (a). Recently in laboratory work the triple beam
balance is mostly used to measure masses. It consists of a pivoted system having a metal plate on
one side and on the other side a combination of three calibrated beams. Three beam are calibrated
as (0-10) g, (0-500) g and (0-1000) g. There are small weights which can easily slide to and fro
along the beams. From the pointers on the small weights we can read the corresponding position
of the weights. If all the weights slide to the zero stop end, zero indicator at the end of the beams
comes to a horizontal position. If there is a change, beams can be brought to a horizontal position
by adjusting the zero adjustment knob.


When the beams of the balance are in horizontal positions the object to be weighed is kept on the
metal plate and the weights are moved on the beams to the right side so that the beams come to
horizontal positions again.


The value of mass of the object can be obtained from the values corresponding to the pointers of
the weights on the beams. The minimum mass that can be measured from the triple beam balance
is 0.1 g. The value of the maximum mass that can be measured, can be increased by hanging the
extra weights 100 g, 500 g and 1000 g form the relevant points. Very small masses can be
measured using electronic balance as shown in Figure 4.14 (b). This is like a compression balance.
When we keep an object to be weighed on the plate there is a digital electronic circuit inside it,
which indicates the value of the mass numerically on the indicator screen according to the thrust
exerted by the object on the plate. Using this instrument we can measure masses up to one
milligram.

###### **Scalar quantities and vector quantities**

Physical quantities can be divided into two categories, namely vector quantities and scalar quantities.

**Scalar quantities**

A scalar quantity is completely specified by its magnitude.

eg. Mass, time, distance, pressure, energy, density, speed, area, volume, work, power


**Vector quantities**

They have both magnitude and direction and obey the law of vector addition.

eg. Displacement, acceleration, impulse, moment, momentum, magnetic flux density, velocity,
force, electric field intensity, gravitational field intensity, weight.

Scalar quantities can be added mathematically (algebraically), but for vector addition, the direction
must also be considered.


A vector can be represented by a line segment geometrically. The length of the line is proportional
to the magnitude of the vector and the direction of the arrow head shows the direction of the
vector (Figure 5.1).

Magnitude of a vector = _AB_ = _AB_

**Chapter 01**

##### **Kinematics**


“How fast” a body moves at a certain instance is described as the velocity of the body at that
instance.


**Definition of velocity**
Velocity is the rate of change of displacement of a body in a certain direction.
Usual symbols used to express velocity is _v_ and _u._
by the definition

_change of displacement_
_velocity_ 
_time_

~~~~ ~~_s_~~
_v_ 
 _t_

         - Velocity is a vector quantity and thus has an associated direction.

         - SI unit of velocity is m s [-1] .


**Relative motion**

**Example 1**

Suppose two motor cars travel along the same direction one followed by the other, with speeds
of 100 km h [-1] . A policeman standing on the side of the road detects their speeds as 100 km h [-1] by
the speed gun. But to one driver, the other seems to be stationary.

This shows that the velocity of an object depends on the “reference frame” of whoever is observing
or measuring the velocity.

In everyday life this reference frame is considered the ground.

For example the police officer detected the speeds of the motor cars as he was at rest. But he
would detect the speed incorrectly if he was moving while detecting the speed.


**Example 2**

A passenger inside a moving vehicle observes that a tree on the ground  moves with a velocity in
opposite direction to his velocity with an equal magnitude. Even though the tree is actually at rest
relative to the frame of reference of the ground, it has a velocity relative to the frame of reference
of the moving vehicle .

The actual velocity of an object that is its velocity relative to the Earth can be indicated by, _v_ A,E
Likewise, the velocity of the object A relative to the frame of reference of the object B can be
indicated as, _v_ A,B..


34


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


The relationship between the velocities relative to different  frames of reference can be obtained
as shown by the following example.

Take A and B as two bodies moving with uniform velocities _v_ A and _v_ B respectively, relative to
the Earth heading in the same direction along the same path.


If they simultaneously pass the same point X with the uniform velocities _v_ A and _v_ B (if _v_ A> _v_ B),


Then,



Velocity of A, _v_ _A_  _s_ 2

_t_



Velocity of B, _vB_  _s_ 1

_t_



That is, relative to B (or as seen by B) during a time ‘ _t_ ’, A has displaced by an amount  _s_,


 _s_ [] ( _s_ 2  _s_ 1 )


 _s_ ( _s_ 2 _s_ 1)
~~~~ 

 _s_ _s_ 2 _s_ 1
 
_t_ _t_ _t_


_v_ A,B  _v_ A  _v_ B


_v_ A,B  _v_ A,E  _v_ B,E

(As the velocities of A and B relative to the
Earth has been concerned, _v_ A _= v_ A,E and _v_ B _= v_ B,E)


35


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


~~Since by  properties of vectors,~~

 _v_ B,E  _v_ E,B


Hence the relationship can be written as,


This shows that the velocity of one body relative to another can be expressed with their
respective velocities relative to a third frame of reference.


**Worked examples**

1. A motor boat (B) speeds at a velocity of 60 km h [-1] towards North. A steady wind (W)
blows from the North at a velocity of 40 km h [-1] . Find the velocity of the wind felt by a

passenger in the boat.


Answer:

_v_ B,E  60  where then _v_ E,B  60  (E represents the Earth)

_v_ W,E  40 

_v_ W,B = _v_ W,E + _v_ E,B

2. A motorcycle (M) travels at a velocity of 100 km h [] 1 along a straight road. As it passes

**Applications**

1. It is observed that the sun moves around the Earth every day. But in the actual motion it is
the Earth that moves (spins) about its axis.

2. When raining, the rain drops fall vertically downwards due to gravity, in still air. But a

person inside a moving train will observe the rain fall at an angle.


**Rectilinear motion under constant acceleration**

**Graphs of motion**
Properties such as displacement, velocity or acceleration can be used to describe a rectilinear

motion of a body. where,

 _displcement_
_velocity_ 
 _time_

 _velocity_
_acceleration_ =

 _time_


37


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


**Displacement - time graph**



When the displacement of a body moving in a certain
direction is plotted against time,the displacement
( _s_ ) - time ( _t_ ) graphs can be obtained.

If the graph of displacement ( _s_ ) - time ( _t_ )

is a straight line,

gradient = tan

gradient  _s_ 2  _s_ 1
_t_ 2  _t_ 1

 _s_

[gradient]  _t_

~~gradient = velocity of the body~~











This shows that if the graph of displacement vs. time ( _t_ ) is a straight line, then the described

motion is a **“uniform velocity”.**


Shown below are the successive positions of a vertically projected ball, when photographed
during its motion under gravity, in equal periods of time.


The shots are captured within equal time intervals
and thus it is clear that when moving upwards its
displacement decreases and when moving
downwords displacement increases.





Hence if its displacement is plotted against time,
the graph will be as shown in Figure 1.4.


38



**Figure** 1.3


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


         -  It is clear that the ball does not travel with a uniform velocity and hence the graph is
non-linear.

 When considering the two points X and Y on the graph, the velocity of the ball at these
two instances will be given by the gradients of the tangents drawn to the graph at the

point X and Y. where,



 _x_

(gradient) = x = (velocity ) x





 _t_







 _y_

(gradient) = y = (velocity ) _y_





 _t_







Since, (gradient ) x > (gradient)y
(velocity)x      > (velocity) y
That is the ball has travelled with a decreasing velocity, or with a “deceleration” verticallyThat is, the ball has travelled with a decreasing velocity, or with a “deceleration”
up wards.vertically up wards.

At the maximum height at the point Z,

(gradient) = 


Therefore, then the body has attained a zero velocity in the vertical direction.


39


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


Similarly, if a motion is represented as follows,


 _x_
_vx_
 _t_



 _y_
_vy_
 _t_
it is clear that,

_vx_  _vy_





**Figure** 1.5





Hence, the motion represented is” **acceleration** ” .


It is also clear that in the motion of the ball projected under gravity, it comes down with an
acceleration.


**Velocity – Time graphs**


When the velocity of a body is plotted against time, the velocity ( _v_ ) - time ( _t_ ) graph can be
obtained.


(1)  Uniform velocity
This is when the velocity of a certain body remains constant with time. Hence the velocity ( _v_ )

  - time ( _t_ ) graph will be as follows.


**Figure** 1.6


Hence a straight line parallel to time axis represents uniform velocity.


40


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


 If the velocity ( _v_ ) - time ( _t_ ) graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis,

It should be noted that since displacement and velocity are vector quantities, it is

Describe the motion of the body between the following points

(1) O to A (2) A to B (3) B to C (4) C to D (5) D to E


Answer :

(1) O to A – Starts the motion from rest and travels with a uniform acceleration (as

gradient is constant and magnitude of velocity increases)


(2) A to B – Uniform velocity (as the gradient is zero at a certain value of velocity)

(3) B to C - Uniform deceleration and comes to rest at C (as the magnitude of
velocity decreases and the gradient is constant).

(4) C to D - Starting from rest body moves in opposite to initial direction with a uniform
acceleration (as the magnitude of velocity increases and velocity is
expressed as negative and gradient is constant)

(5) D to E - Body moves with a uniform deceleration in a direction opposite to the
initial direction and comes to rest at E (as the magnitude of velocity
decreases and velocity values are expressed as negative and also the
gradient is constant).


3. A rubber ball is thrown vertically upwards under gravity with a velocity of 40 m s [] 1 .
When it returns to the level of projection, it collides with a horizontal surface and rebounds
with a velocity half of the velocity of collision.

(1) Draw the displacement ( _s_ ) - time ( _t_ ) graph and velocity ( _v_ ) - time ( _t_ )

graph to express the motion described above.

(2) (a) Determine time between the starting moment and the first collision

(b) Determine the maximum height that by the ball reached.

Answer :

(1)  When the ball is thrown up against gravity, it moves upwards with a uniform deceleration

10 m s [-2] ( _g_ ), then reaches the maximum height and then fall along the same line in opposite

direction with an equal magnitude of acceleration of 10 m s [-2 ] ( _g_ ) and will return the same

level of projection with a velocity 40 m s [-1] (equal to velocity of projection).

**Equations of motion**

The relationships between the physical properties that describe a particular motion of a body are

called equations of motion.

If the initial velocity of a body is ‘ _u_ ’, and if this body moves along a **straight line** with a

**uniform acceleration** ‘ _a’_ for a period ‘ _t_ ’ and obtains a final velocity ‘ _v_ ’ making a displacement

‘ _s_ ’, its motion can be expressed by a velocity vs. time graph as in Figure 1.9.

**Motion under gravity**

The motion under the action of gravitational force, with negligible
resistances, such as air resistance, is called motion under gravity.



**Example – 1**

A fruit falling from a tree


 _F = ma_
_mg = m a_ 

 _a_ =  m s _g_ -2 _; g_   - gravitational acceleration
_g_ = 10 m s [-2 ] near the surface of the Earth


**Example – 2**

If a man skiing  on ice (of negligible friction) slides down along an inclined bank,

_F_  _m a_

_m_ gsinθ = _m_  _a_

_a_ =  sin _g_ _θ_

Hence when the inclination  increases, his acceleration

increases.





**Projectile motion**
You may have seen cricketers batting to earn 6 marks on the score. The ball flies along a curved
path. Such a motion of an object is called a projectile motion. Have you thought about the
Science behind the motion of the ball? How far the ball goes depends on several factors. They
are,

1. The magnitude of initial velocity given to the object

2. Angle of projection (inclination of the direction of initial velocity to the horizontal direction)

Coaches consider these factors when guiding a batsman to hit the ball to get a sixer.

Projectile motion is a combination of horizontal and vertical motion. So we can study this by
considering the effect on horizontal and vertical components.

Consider a case when a batsman strikes a ball projecting it at an angle  to the horizontal.


46


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


Considering the effect on the vertical component,

Vertical component of initial velocity  _u_ sin 

_acceleration_  _g_ 

 _v_ = _u + at_

_v_ 2 [  = sin -  ] _u_  _g_  < sin _t_ _u_ 

 [ Vertical component of velocity decreases.]


This decreases until it reaches zero. After that, due to the gravitational force acting on the body,
vertical component of the velocity gradually increases in downward direction until it hits the
ground.

So the vertical motion of the object is simillar to a motion under gravity.

Considering the effect on the horizontal component,

 _u_ cos, Since  horizontally **,**

Acceleration = 0
_v = u + at_

_v_ 1  _u_ cos

Horizontal component remains constant. In determining the velocity of the ball at a given time
using vector addition, it is clear that its trajectory is a parabola.


**Worked Examples**

**Force and motion**


The exact link between force and motion is not easy to find in everyday life. It is not that force is
needed to maintain motion. Push a heavy box across a rough floor with a uniform velocity and
you may mistakenly conclude that motion needs force. In fact the “hidden” force of friction
confuses the link.

The general link between force and motion is that unbalanced (resultant) force is required to
change motion. In other words, to change the velocity of an object, the object must be acted on
by an unbalanced force. If there is no unbalanced resultant force on an object, its velocity must
stay the same. If there is an unbalanced force on an object, its velocity must change.

**Inertia**



Try the following activity.


post card



coin



glass


**Figure** 3.1

A coin is placed on a post card. Pull the card away quickly. Coin will not move away with the
card. Coin will drop into the glass. What prevented it from moving with the card? It is the mass
of the coin. Since the coin has more mass than the postcard, it resists moving with the card. This
resistance to change the state of motion is called inertia. The more mass something has the more
inertia it has.


**Inertial mass**

Mass is a measure of inertia. Inertial mass indicates the opposition of a body to change of motion
when responding to all types of forces.


**Gravitational mass**

Gravitational mass is determined by the strength of the gravitational force experienced by a body
when it is in a gravitational field. Experiments show that to a high degree of accuracy these two
masses are equal for a given body.


58


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


**Frame of reference**

Motion of a body is always described with reference to some well defined co-ordinate system.
This co-ordinate system is referred to as ‘frame of reference’. In three dimensional space a
frame of reference consists of three mutually perpendicular lines called ‘axes of frame of reference’
meeting at a single point called origin.


**Inertial frames**

A frame of reference that remains at rest or moves with constant velocity with respect to other
frames of reference is called ‘Inertial Frame of Reference’. An inertial frame of reference is
actually an unaccelerated frame of reference. Newton’s laws of motion are valid in all inertial
frames of reference. According to Newton’s first law when a body or system of bodies is not
accelerating, a resultant force is not acted upon it. Since the inertial frames are not accelerating,
no external force is acted upon from outside the frame. So in this frame of reference, since the
system is not accelerating the body is not acted upon by external forces.

Eg:
Our earth (Although the Earth is not exactly inertial, we assume it to be inertial )

A space shuttle moving with constant velocity relative to the earth.

A rocket moving with constant velocity relative to the earth.


**Non-Inertial frames**

A frame of reference is said to be a non-inertial frame of reference when it is moving nonuniformly (accelerating) relative to an inertial frame. In non-inertial frame of reference, Newton’s
laws of motion are not valid.


**Newton’s first law of motion**

This law explains the exact link between force and motion.


~~**Newton's first law of motion**~~

Every object continues to be at rest or move with uniform velocity

unless acted upon by a resultant force.


**Momentum**
When a mass is moving its momentum is given by,

~~momentum = mass × velocity~~


~~_p_~~ ~~~~ ~~_mv_~~


The unit of momentum is . Momentum is a vector quantity. Its direction is the same as

the direction of velocity..

_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_

If a model car has a masss of 2 kg and a velocity of 2, its


momentum = mass × velocity

**Newton’s second law of motion**



1



Newton’s first law states that a resultant force can change the state of motion of an object.
Newton’s second law states about this resultant force.


**Newtown’s second law**
The rate of change of moments of an object is proportional to the unbalanced
(resultant) force which acts on the object.


The direction of the unbalanced (resultant) force is the same as the direction of the momentum
change.

Consider an object of fixed mass _m_ acted upon by a constant resultant forc _F_ . Suppose the
object is accelerated from velocity _u_ to velocity _v_ in time _t._




[Change of momentum = final momentum-initial momentum = ] _[mv - mu]_



Change of momentum per second = _[mv - mu]_

**Impulse and impulsive force**


A large force accting in a very small period of time is an impulsive force.
Ex:- i. Shot on a nail by a hammer
ii. Stroke on a ball by a bat.


~~Impulse = Impulsive force x Time of action of the force~~

The unit of impulse is N s.

 _v_  _u_ 
 _m_    _t_
 _t_ 
 _mv_  _mu_

The quantity on the left-hand side is called the impulse, the product of force and time, and is
measured in N s. The quantity on the right-hand side is the change of momentum produced by
this impulse.


~~Impulse = Change in momentum~~

Large force acting for a short time may cause the same change of momentum as small force
acting for a long time. You use this every time you jump off something and bend your knees on
landing. If you were to land rigidly, your momentum would fall to zero in a very short time. The
large rate of change of momentum would exert large forces on your body and probably cause
injuries. Bending your knees allows the same change of momentum to occur over a longer time
and so reduces the force on your body. A similar principle applies in the use of air bags to make
cars safer.


61


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


**Principle of conservation of linear momentum**

According to Newton’s second law resultant force is proportional to the rate of change of
momentum. So if the resultant force acted upon is zero, it implies that momentum does not
change.

Now consider a system of objects interacting with each other. If no external resultant force acts
on this system of objects, the total momentum does not change. However, within the system, the
interactions between the objects cause transfer of momentum between them. But the total
momentum stays constant.


**Principle of conservation of linear momentum**

For a system of interacting objects, the momentum remains constant, provided no external
force acts on the system.

**Newton’s third law of motion**

When you push on a wall, did you fall through the wall? You may say no. What prevented you
from going through the wall? The wall pushes back on you with an equal and opposite force. If
the wall suddenly gives way, the push back on you is removed allowing you to fal towards the
wall.

When the objects interact (collide), they exert equal and oppsite forces on one another.

Consider piece of rope which is stretched along. What force prevents it from breaking? It is a
force called tension.


**Figure** 3.3


If this force is always acting in the rope, it has to be shrinked. But it does not happen. So this
force appears only when it is stretched. When you pull the rope this force adjusts itself to prevent
the breakage of the rope. When you increase the pulling force the tension force also will be
increased. Since this tension force adjusts itself it is called as a **“self-adjusting force”.**

Tension, thrust or compression and friction are self-adjusting forces.


**Thrust or compression**

This acts in a way of opposite to the tension. For example when you push a small piece of wood
by both your hands a force of compression appears to prevent it from breaking.


65


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


This force is changing itself to balance the external force given by hands. So it is also a selfadjusting force.

Eg :



**Figure** 3.5


**Frictional force**



Thrust force acts along the support to
prevent the free from falling.



Friction is the force that tries to stop materials sliding across each other. Frictional force prevents
or opposes relative motion. Microscopically all surfaces are rough. When such two surfaces
placed in contact there will be regions where the irregularities interlock, and points where high
pressure may result in temporary bonds. Any attempt to slide the surfaces over one another will
require a certain amount of work to be done, lifting and deforming the surface. This will require
a force as the surface moves.

In some circumstances friction is unwanted because it wastes energy. However at some
circumstances friction is useful. For example, braking a car are applied, friction between the
wheels and the road surface is essential if the car is to be slowed down.


**Static friction**

Sometimes the force applied is not large enough to overcome the friction. So, no movement
takes place, though a force is applied. The friction acting in this situation is called static friction.


66


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


So static friction acts between surfaces at rest when a force is applied to make them slide past
one another.

Think of sliding a heavy case across a horizontal floor. If you push it gently it doesn’t move. Push
it a bit harder and it still doesn’t move. In both cases the static frictional force has balanced the
applied force. Static friction adjusts itself to equalize the applied force until the object starts to
move.


**Limiting frictional force**

However, with enough force applied, the force of friction can be overcome and then movement
takes place. The frictional force acting when the surfaces just begin to slip past one another is
called the limiting frictional force.

Consider a case in which a man tries to push a heavy box on a rough horizontal surface.


**Figure** 3.6


If we plot the frictional force against the applied force, the shape of the graph will be as shown in
Figure 3.7.

Applied force


Point ‘A’ indicates the instant at which the box just begins to slip over the surface. So, the friction
at that instant is the limiting frictional force.
After point ‘A’ the box moves over the surface and the frictional force remains constant. The
friction acting when the box is moving is called dynamic friction.


67


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


Although the frictional force between real surfaces will vary from one place to the next as the
local surface changes, it is possible to describe sliding friction by a fairly simple rule. This rule
links the normal force between the two surfaces(that is how hard they are pressed together) to



the frictional force acting on them when they just begin to slip past one another(the limiting
friction)

limiting friction between surfaces  normal contact force between surfaces


_F_  _R_

_F_   _R_

 is called the **coefficient of static friction** and is roughly constant for a particular pair of
surfaces.


**Dynamic (or kinetic) friction**

The friction acting between two surfaces as they slide over one another is called dynamic friction.
At the instant the surfaces just begin to slide the above relationship _F_   _R_ is valid and there the
dynamic friction is equal to the limiting frictional force.

The dynamic friction acting on an object is also proportional to the normal contact force between
surfaces. If the dynamic friction is _F_ d and normal contact force is _R_,



_Fd_  _R_



_d_









_Fd_   _d_ _R_



_d_ _d_



 _d_ is called the coefficient of dynamic friction.

According to the graph in Figure 3.7,

_F_   - _Fd_

>  _d_

So, the coefficient of dynamic friction is always less than the coefficient of limiting friction.


**Worked example**

(i) A man is trying to push a packing case of weight 300 N across a horizontal floor. What
is the minimum horizontal force required to slide it, if the coefficient of limiting friction
between the case and the floor is 0.3?

To slide the case the applied force must just equal the limiting friction.

_F_   _R_  0.3 300  90N

(ii) Finally the man was able to push the packing case over the floor. When he started
pushing, he felt that the packing case is easily moving with less effort. He only needed
87 N force to maintain a constant velocity. Calculate the coefficient of dynamic friction.

**Equilibrium of Forces**


The bridge in the Figure 4.1 is built not to be collapsed under large amounts of loads. This is done
by designing each part of the bridge to be under equilibrium with heavy loads. So equilibrium acts
an important role when building stable structures.


**Conditions for Equilibrium**


**Figure** 4.1

As it is known, equilibrium is the state in which a body is at rest without any translatory motion
or rotation when it is acted upon by a system of forces. For this to happen, it is clear that the main
condition for equilibrium of a system of forces is that when subjected to composition the system
should not

reduce to a single force or resultant (to prevent motion) and also to a couple of forces or torque

( to prevent rotation). Considering this main condition, the necessary and sufficient conditions for

equilibrium, depending on the number of forces in the system, can be stated as follows.


**1. Conditions for the equilibrium of two forces.**

**States of equilibrium**





There could be many ways in which a body can be placed in equilibrium. These are called states
of equilibrium of which one would be safe, another moderately safe and yet another unsafe. The
three main states of equilibrium are known as

1. Stable equilibrium

2. Unstable equilibrium

3. Neutral equilibrium

Eg :


**Figure** 4.6


72


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


Consider an empty bottle which is placed in three states as follows.
1. Stable equilibrium

If a body which is in equilibrium, when displaced slightly from its equilibrium position and
released, returns to its original equilibrium position, then the body is in stable equilibrium.
2. Unstable equilibrium

If the body which slightly displaced as above and released does not return to its original
equilibrium position, then the body is in unstable equilibrium.
3. Neutral equilibrium
If the body in equilibrium when displaced slightly as above and released remains to be in
its new equilibrium position, then the body is in neutral equilibrium.


From the above three states of equilibrium it can be seen that the unstable equilibrium position is
the most unsafe position.


It can also be seen that lower the position of the centre of gravity of a body the more stable or
safe the body is. However the main factor of stability of a body is the potential energy possessed
by the body. Lesser the potential energy (mgh) of a body, more stable the body is and as the
potential energy increases the body becomes more unstable.


**Worked example**

A body of mass 500 g is hung from a fixed point by means of an inextensible, light string and is
then pulled aside by a horizontal force F until the string is inclined at 60o to the horizontal.

**Work, energy and power**


~~_s_~~


**Figure** 5.1

If a body gets displaced when an external unbalanced force acts on it, then that force is said to do
work.

The amount of work done is given by the product of the displacement of the point of action of the
force and the force acting in that direction.


~~Work done = Force x Displacement~~







~~_s_~~


**Figure** 5.2


If the force is acting at an inclination to the displacement, then the work done is equal to the
product of the component of the force in the direction of the displacement and the displacement.

work done = cos . _F_  _s_

= _F.s_ cos 

**Energy**

Energy is introduced as the capability of doing work.

When a body does work, the body releases an amount of energy equal to it, while when work is
done on the body an equal amount of energy is stored in it.

The unit of measurement of energy is the joule (J), the same as the unit of work.

Energy exists in various forms such as light, sound, heat, electricity, chemical, nuclear and
mechanical energy, the latter being subdivided into potential energy and kinetic energy.


75


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


**Potential energy and kinetic energy**

When a body on the ground is raised from the ground to a higher level, a certain amount of work
is done on it and this work is stored in it as energy. This energy is referred to as potential energy.
Also work has to be done on a body at rest in order to make it move and this work too is stored
in it as energy which is referred to as kinetic energy.


**Kinetic energy**

As mentioned above kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a moving body showing that a
moving body has a capability of doing work unlike a body at rest.
If a body is in linear motion the kinetic energy possessed by it is called translational kinetic
energy. The kinetic energy possessed by a rotating body is called rotational kinetic energy.


**Translational kinetic energy**

When a body moving with a velocity _v_ is added upon by an opposing force _F,_ let the body comes
to rest after moving a distance _s._

**Potential energy**

Potential energy has two forms namely gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy.


**Gravitational potential energy**

The mechanical energy stored in a body due to its position in the gravitational field is known as
gravitational potential energy.


Suppose that a body of mass _m_ is raised from position A
to a position B at a height _h._ The force of gravitational
attraction acting on the body is _F_  _mg_ vertically
downwards. Work has to be done against this force and
hence this work is

_W_  _F s_ .  _W_  _mgh_
This work gets stored in the body as gravitational potential
energy.


~~Gravitational potential energy =~~ ~~_mgh_~~


**Figure** 5.4

When the body is lowered from position A to a position C at a height _h_ energy is released. Hence
the gravitational potential energy at position C is less than that at position A.
Gravitational potential energy at C  _mgh_
Accordingly if the gravitational potential energy at some level in a gravitational field is considered
zero, the gravitational potential energy at a height _h_ above that level is  _mgh_ .
While that at a height h below that level is  _mgh_ .


**Elastic potential energy**
A stretched spring (or a rubber band) or a compressed spring has an ability to do work. This
energy possessed by a spring is called elastic potential energy.

If _x_ is the extension in a spring acted upon by a force _F,_ then this extension is directly proportional
to the magnitude of the force.

The constant of proportionality _k_ is known as the spring constant. The energy stored in such a
spring is given by

**Efficiency**

The energy possessed by an equipment cannot be totally converted into useful energy as a part
of it gets converted into other forms(eg. heat). Thus a portion of the energy gets wasted.

~~power input~~

**Principle of conservation of energy**

The total energy of a closed system remains constant.

However, within a system one form of energy can get converted into another form of energy.


79


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


Eg.: In a vehicle the energy of the fuel (petrol) gets converted into heat, sound and mechanical
energy.

The potential energy possessed by the water at the top of a hydro-power house loses this energy
when falling to the bottom and gets converted into kinetic energy on the turbines. This energy is
converted into electrical energy by the turbines.


**Principle of conservation of mechanical energy**

If in a certain process the conservation of energy takes place only between kinetic energy and
potential energy, then in that process the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy
remains a constant. This is the principle of conservation of mechanical energy.


kinetic energy  potential energy  constant

1 _mv2_ + _mgh_ = _k_

In some cases, potential energy may be in the
forms of gravitational and elastic potential energy.
Kinetic energy may also be in the forms of
translational and rotational kinetic energy.

Eg: A mango hanging from a tree at a height of
3.2 m from the ground, drops from rest
and falls on to the ground. Find the
velocity of the mango when it strikes the
ground (disregard the air resistance).

**Rotational motion and circular motion**


Most of the motions in the universe can be explained by straight line and rolational motion.
Straight line motion is determined by the straight line distance changes and the rotational motion
is determined by the angular changes.



**Angular Displacement (**  **)**
The angular displacement is the rotation of a point or a
straight line about a particular axis in a particular sense.


It is a scalar quantity.


If a particle at P, at a distance _r_ from the origin ‘O’ rotates

through an angle  and if _s_ is the are length,

_s_
Then 
_r_

= _s_ _r_ 
Unit of  is radian which is denoted by the symbol ‘rad’.









**Figure** 6.1



**Radian**
1 rad is equivalent to the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc equal in length to the
radius.
Since the circumference of a circle of radius r is 2 _r_ [, the angle subtended at the centre of the]

circle by the circumference is [1]  2 _r_  2
_r_

Thus 360 [] is equal to 2rad,


**Angular velocity (**  **)**
The angular velocity is the rate of change of
angular displacement.  It is a vector quantity.
Direction is given by righthand cork screw
rule.

**Worked example**
A fan was rotating at a speed of 10 rounds per second. Due to a power failure fan became still
with a constant angular deceleration after 10 seconds. Find the angular deceleration of the fan.

Final angular velocity 0 0

  0  210 2 rad s 2

Note :- The angular acceleration can occur in three ways.
1. Change of magnitude without changing the direction of the angular velocity.
2. Change of direction of angular velocity without changing the magnitude.
3. Both the magnitude and direction changes of angular velocity.


If only the magnitude of the angular velocity changes without changing the rotating plane, then the
direction of the angular acceleration is along the direction of the angular velocity.

If the rotating plane changes, angular acceleration will be along the direction of the change of
angular velocity.

Therefore, for a particle moving along a circular path with uniform angular vdocity, the acceleration
along the tongent is zero. But there is an accaleration towards the centre, normal to the tangent.

This acceleration is the centripetal acceleration. Since the
direction of motion of the particle changes with time, the particle
has this acceleration.


If the particle rotates with nonuniform angular velocity, it will have
an acceleration along the tangent also.
Then the resultant acceleration will not be towards the centre.The

**Moment of Inertia (** _**I**_ **)**
The mass of a body is a measure of its reluctance to any change of linear motion. The corresponding
property for rotational motion is called moment of inertia.
If a particle _P_ of mass _m_ is revolving (rotating) in a circular path of radius _r,_ then the moment of
Inertia of P about the centre O is given by

The quantity _I_ is called the “moment of inertia” of the object about the axis of rotation. “ _I_ ” depends
on the position of the axis of rotation and how the mass of the body is distributed about it.

After a small time if she bend her hands
with the body she will revolve faster.
According to the law of conservation of

(2) A student sitting on a freely rotating stool holds
two heavy weights in his extended arms.When
he bring the weights in, the speed of rotation
increases.When he extends his arms,the speed
of rotation decreases. According to the Law of
conservation of angular momentum, with the
changes of moment of inertia, angular velocity
of the rotating system changes.







**Figure** 6.18



(3) The diver leaves the high diving board above the swimming pool,
gets the vertical velocity by pulling the board. He then bends and
pulls his arms and legs (Figure 6.19) so that the moment of Inertia
is to decrease. Hence the angular velocity will increase. So he
will revolve very fast at height. When he gets closer the water
level he extends his legs and arms as shown and gets his angular
velocity reduced.


(4) When the string inside the tube is pulled downwards.
The angular velocity of the particle revolving on the
table will increase.


As _r_ decreases _I_ will decrease. To keep _I_ 
constant,  will increase.

(5) Since angular momentum is a vector quantity,
keeping the magnitude constant, if only the
direction is changed that is enough to affect
the system. This can be shown using a cycle
wheel. A person sitting on a rotating chair is
keeping the rotating cycle wheel as shown in
Figure 6.21 (i). The direction of the angular
moment is shown in the figure. If he turns the
wheel upside down as shown in Figure 6.21
(ii). Then the chair will start to rotate in the
opposite direction to which the wheel is
rotating.
According to the law of conservation of angular
momentum,









Initial angular Initial angular Angular momentum Angular momentum
momentum of + momentum of   = of the wheel after it  +  of man and chair
the wheel the man and chair    has turned down after the wheel turned down
_L_ + 0 = _- L_ + _L’_
_L’_ = _2L_


Here even though the magnitude of the angular momentum of the wheel is not changing the
direction has changed.
Hence the chair will rotate with double the angular momentum of the initial value.


**Applications related to reluctance to change of angular momentum**
 _t =_  _L_
Torque  Time = Change of angular momentum



The above equation shows that a torque should be
applied to change the angular momentum.







(1) When a bycycle is driven it will be in equilibrium by itself without falling down. But when the
cycle is not moving, it is difficult to keep in equilibrium.

(2) Spinning top will be in equilibrium when it is rotating.
It will fall when the spin stops.



(3) The bullet from the gun will attack the target correctly only if
the bullet is moving with rotation. If there is no rotation it will
follow a path of a projectile.


(4)  The young coconut will not burst when it falls while rotating.
Its angular momentum is in the vertical downward direction.
Therefore, it hits the ground vertically and minimizes the
possibility of bursting.


(5) When rabaana is rotated by a man, it will be in equilibrium.
But it cannot be kept in equilibrium if it is not rotating.


**Circular motion**


When a body moves along a circular path around a fixed
point or an axis outside it as the centre, the body is said to
perform circular motion.



**Figure** 6.23


**Figure** 6.24

##### _v_

**Figure** 6.25


**Figure** 6.26


###### _v_



Eg. :- 1. A stone attached to the end of a string being whirled around a circular path.
2. Earth orbiting around the Sun along an approximately circular path.
3. A motorcycle or a bicycle taking a circular bend.


91


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


To study circular motion consider a body attached to a string being
whirled around a circular path with a constant speed.
When the velocity of the body is considered its magnitude is constant
since the speed is constant. However along a circular path the direction
of the velocity is continuously changing.


**Figure** 6.27


When any one of magnitude or direction is changing it means that the velocity is changing. Changing
velocity means acceleration.
Hence it can be concluded that any body performing circular motion is doing so with an acceleration,
even if the speed is constant.

Let _v_ and _A_ _v_ be the velocities of the body at two _B_

points A and B seperated by the time interval  _t_


It can be seen that the vector




**>**
_v_



_vB_  _vA_  _vB_  _vA_  passes through the centre O

of the circle. Hence the acceleration _a_  _vB_  _vA_
 _t_
is directed towards the centre of the circular path.



**Figure** 6.28



Thus the acceleration of a body performing circular motion is directed towards the centre of the
circle and is hence known as “centripetal acceleration”.
It can be proved that if _v_ is the speed and _r_ is the radius of the circle.

Since a body is moving with an acceleration only under the action of an external force, a body
performing circular motion is doing so under the action of an external force acting in the direction
of the centripetal acceleration. This force is thus known as “centripetal force” and is given by.

However since this centripetal force has to act at the centre of gravity G of the system, a couple
of forces tending to topple the system begins to act on it as shown in Figure 6.29.

In order to prevent the toppling, the system, motorcycle and the rider bends inwards to form a
counter couple of forces from the weight ( _mg_ ) and the reaction ( _R_ ) on the system.

**Hy** d **rostatics**


It is known to us that matter exists in 3 states which are called solids, liquids and gases. Although
a solid has a defined shape, liquids and gases do not have definite shapes and hence their
behaviour is different to that of solids. Thus a study regarding liquids and gases becomes more
important technologically as well as scientifically.

The field of study on fluids is referred to as fluid machines. Fluids at rest and fluids in motion
exhibit different properties. Hence it is possible to explain this field under two headings namely

1.  Hydrostatics

2.  Fluid dynamics

There are a number of physical quantities of importance when identifying fluids from one another.
Density takes prominence one of these qualities

**Density**



The mass of a substance changes according its volume. The mass of a unit volume of a substance
is termed its density.



Mass
Density = 
~~Volume~~



Symbols such as and _d_ are used to represent density. Since we are used to symbolize mass
with _m_ and volume with _V_, the equation for density can be written as,



_m_

_V_



The standard unit of measuring density is kg m [-3] Sometimes the unit g cm [-3] is also used practically.

1 g cm [-3] = 1000 kg m [-3]

The density of a fluid changes according to temperature and pressure. Generally the density
decreases with increasing temperature . But there are instances where it in not so. The table
below shows the densities of few fluids at a pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 4 oC.







96


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


When the pressure of certain fluids increase their densities increase. This happens if the fluid is
compressible. Our study in this field is confided to incompressible fluids.


**Incompressible fluids**

“Those fluids which do not undergo any changes in volume when subjected to pressure are
known as incompressible fluids”

Lequids used by us do not undergo appreciable volume changes when subjected to pressure and
hence are incompressible fluids.


**Homogeneous fluids**

Those fluids at all points of which the density has the same value are known as homogeneous
fluids.

When the pressure of a gas at rest is increased its value changes largely and hence gases are
called compressible fluids. As only the liquids are incompressible fluids the study of fluids at rest
is named Hydrostatics.


**Relative density**

The density of substance relative to that of water is called the relative density of the substance



Relative density



density of substance


~~density of water~~



When the density of the substance is denoted by  and the density of water by  _w_, then



Relative density =








_w_



Since relative density is a ratio of equal quantities it has no units . When the relative density of

a substance is given, its density can be obtained in SI units by multiplying the relative density by

1000


Relative density can also be expressed as the ratio between the masses of equal volumes of



substance and water.


Relative density



mass of a given volume of subsance


~~mass of an equal volume of water~~



**Hydrostatic pressure**

When an air bubble released from the bottom of a deep vessel of
water is observed it can be seen that the bubble becomes larger when
rising through the water. Figure 7.1 illustrates this. The reason for the
bubble to be small at the bottom is that the water column above it
exerts a pressure on it. **Figure 7.1**

97


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


Figure 7.2 illustrates how forces act on the bubble. When the bubble
ascends the height of the water column above it decreases, thus
decreasing the pressure on it. Hence the bubble becomes larger.


**Figure** 7.2


Pressure is defined as the force on a unit area of a surfaces, normal to that surface. Accordingly,
if _F_ is the force acting normally on an area _A_ of a surface, then the pressure there is.

_F_
_p_ 
_A_

The S.I. unit of pressure is N m [-2] and this unit is known as “pascal” (Pa).


1 Pa = 1 N m -2


Pressure has no definite direction. Hence pressure is considered as a scalar quantity. A few other
units are also in use to measure pressure. They are atmospheres (atm), mm Hg, bar and torr.

Pressure of one millimetre of mercury (1 mm Hg) means the pressure exerted by a mercury
column of height 1mm. The value of each of these units in pascals is given below.

1 atm = 1 x 10 [5] Pa

1 bar = 1 x 10 [5] Pa

1 torr = 1mm Hg = 133.3 Pa

In order to develop an expression for hydrostatic pressure, consider a horizontal surface of area

_A_ at a depth _h_ below the surface of a liquid of density .

Since the volume of the liquid above the horizontal surface considered is _Ah_,

Weight of the liquid column = _Ah_  _g_

As pressure is the force acting normally
on a unit area,



_Ah g_ 
_p_   _h g_ 
_A_

This is the expression for the hydrostatic pressure

at O.

But in addition to the hydrostatic pressure offered by the liquid

column, the air above the liquid surface too exerts a pressure.

This pressure, exerted by the atmospheric air, is known as

atmospheric pressure.


98

O _[A]_


**Figure** 7.3


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


**Atmospheric pressure**

The atmosphere exists to a large height from the earth surface. The density of the air in the
atmosphere gradually decreases with the increase of height; Any object in the environment is
acted upon by a pressure due to the weight of the air above it. This pressure is atmospheric
pressure . The atmospheric pressure gradually decreases upwards from the sea level . At a
height of about 5600 m above the sea level the atmospheric pressure is about a half of the
pressure at the sea level.


**Measurement of atmospheric pressure**



Torricelli
vaccum


Scale


Mercury





Figure 7.4 shows the apparatus constructed by the Italian
scientist Torricelli to measure atmospheric pressure. It is known
as the mercury barometer. When a tube of about 1 m long and
closed at one end is filled with mercury and inverted into a
trough of mercury, the mercury will be found to remain as a
colum in the tube and Torricelli revealed that this height
measures the atmospheric pressure. Since a vacuum exists
above the mercury column in the tube, the pressure at the point
A is caused by the weight of the mercury column above.

Hence _pA_  _h g_ 





The pressure at the point B which is at the same level, is also
the same. It is caused by the atmospheric pressure. Hence the

**Figure** 7.4 atmospheric pressure is given by _hpg_ . is the density of

mercury, while _h_ is the height of the mercury column and g is
the acceleration due to gravity. Torricelli has found that the mercury barometric height at the sea
level is 760 mm. It is this pressure that has been standardized as 1 atmosphere.

According to _p_  _h g_ 

_p_ = 760 x 10 [-3] x 13600 x 10

= 1.01325 x10 [5] Pa

For the convenience of calculations this value is used as 1 x 10 [5] Pa. However, 760 mm Hg is
also used as atmospheric pressure on many occasions.


Why mercury is being used as the barometer liquid is due to its high density. If water were used
as the barometer liquid, the height of the Barometer tube to be used for a pressure of a atmosphere
would be as high as 10 m.


According to meters that we can see at filling stations and service stations, the units used to
measure pressure of air inside vehicle tyres are “pounds per square inch (PSI)” and “ kilograms
per square centimeter ( kg cm )”.-2

Consider a point A at a depth _h_ below the surface of a liquid
exposed to the atmosphere. If _p_ is the pressure at the point _A,_

_p = p0_ + _h g_ 


where _p0_ is the atmospheric pressure and is the density of the
liquid.

**Pascal’s principle on transmission of pressure**

Distribution of pressure in an incompressible fluid contained in a closed vessel when subjected
to an external pressure was investigated by the scientist Pascal and his findings are included in
Pascal’s principle which is stated below.


“The pressure applied at a certain point of an incompressible enclosed fluid at rest is transmitted
undiminished to all the other points of the fluid as well as to the walls of the container containing
the fluid”.



**Figure** 7.6



This principle is technically very important and has many
applications, one of which is the hydraulic press.


The Figure 7.6 shows a simple setup of the hydraulic
press. This set up consists of a vertical cylindrical tube X
of narrow cross – section and another vertical cylindrical
tube Y of wide cross – section. These are connected by
a horizontal tube and the apparatus is filled with a liquid
such as oil. Two movable pistons are placed on the liquid
surfaces in the two vertical tubes and on the two pistons
are placed two loads.



By placing a certain load on the smaller piston a heavier load can be raised by placing it on the
larger piston. The relationship between the forces can be obtained as follows.

**Hydraulic jack**

The hydraulic jack is used to raise vehicles for purposes such as servicing of vehicles. By operating
the lever attached to the small piston, it is possible to raise the vehicle by the larger piston. By
increasing the AC and AB length ratio, the force required to raise the vehicle can be further
decreased.

pedal is fitted to apply a force on the piston in the main cylinder. The pressure applied to the
liquid contained in the main cylinder is transmitted to the pistons with large tags crosssection.
These pistons offer considerably large force to spot the vehicle.


**Operation of components of heavy vehicles**

Figure7.9 shows a backaw engine. Pistons
that are used to offer the force required
to operate various components have
different cross sections. The pressure
caused by the force applied to the main
piston is transmitted to the other pistons
to create the required force.

**Example**

Figure 7.10 shows a simple set up of a hydraulic jack
. The radii of cross – sections of the pistons P1 and
P2 are 4 cm and 20 cm respectively. A force of 6400
N is required to be applied by the large piston to to
raise a motor car to change a wheel. The lever bar is
pivoted at A.

**Upthrust**

When a plastic ball is dropped to water it floats, When it is pressed into water by hand the
hand feels a force acting upwards in it. When the hand releases the ball rises to the surface. This
happens due to an upward force acting on the ball. This force is known as the ‘upthrust’ or the
force of buoyancy.

Activity in Figure 7.12 can be used to find the upthrust.



**Figure** 7.10



If _w1_ is the reading in a newton spring balance when a
small stone is suspended from it and _w2_ the reading when
the same stone is totally immersed in water. Then apparent
loss in weight = _w_ 1  _w_ 2

Since this loss in weight is due to the upthrust,

Upthrust _U_ = _w1 - w2_


103


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


When a body is immersed in a liquid the body displaces a volume of liquid. Greek astronomer
Archimedes (287-212 BC) succeeded in determining a relationship between the volume of the
liquid displaced and the upthrust. This relationship introduced by him is known as Archimedes’
principle.


**Archimedes’ Principle**

When a body is completely or partially immersed in a fluid at rest, it experiences an upthrust
equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.

If a volume _V_ of a body is immersed in a fluid of density , the upthrust according to Archimedes
principle, is

~~_U_~~ ~~~~ ~~_V_~~ ~~~~ ~~_g_~~

In order to verify Archimedes’ principle theoretically, consider a cylindrical object of height _h_
immersed with its axis vertical in a liquid of density .

If _A_ is the area of cross – section of the cylinder and _H_ the height of the liquid surface from the
top surface of the cylinder then the pressure of liquid on the top surface of the cylinder is _H g_ 

Hence _F_ 1 [ = ] _AH g_ 





**Figure** 7.11





 _Ah_  _g_



Since the pressure on the bottom surface of the cylinder is _F2_ = ( _H + h_ ) g

Upthrust  _F_ 2    - _F_ 1



 _h_  _h_ g  _AH_ g

 _A_ _h_  _h_ g 



g  _AH_ g



= _Ah_ g



_Ah_



g



_U_  _V_ g

Above _V_ is the volume of the cylinder. Since the displaced volume is the same, Archimedes’
principle is verified theoretically.

Shown in the Figure 7.14 below is a set up which can be used to verify Archimedes’ principle
practically.

Place a beaker on an electronic balance and adjust the balance to read zero. Direct the exit tube
of a displacement vessel filled with water into the beaker. Suspend a small stone from a spring
balance to record its reading ( _w1_ ) and lower the stone into the displacement vessel to immerse it
completely in the water. Record the reading ( _w2_ ) again.

If the difference between these two reading ( _w1 - w2_ ) equals the reading of electronic balance,
Archimedes’ principle will be verified.


**Determination of mean density of a body using**
**Archimedes’ principle**

Archimedes’ principle can be used to determine the mean
density of a body as follows.



As show in the Figure 7.15 the body is hung from a
balance and the reading _w1_ of the balance is recorded.
The body is next immersed completely in water and the
reading _w2_ of the balance is recorded again.


105



**Figure** 7.13


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_



Then the upthrust acting on the body, _U = w1 – w2_
According to Archimedes’ principle, the weight of an equal volume of water is equal to the
upthrust.

**Example**

When a block of metal is suspended from a spring balance and weighed in air the reading was

the mean density of the metal in the block.

**Floatation**

If a body is to float in a liquid, the forces on it should be in equilibrium. That is, the upthrust
should be equal to the weight of the body.



_m g_ = _U_

This relation is known as the principle of floatation.

Shown below are two states of floatation of a body.

flotation of a body

Since _V_ - V'

_d_   _w_



The mean density of the body is less than the density of water .

To increase the amount immersed, the mean density of the body should be made less. For this
purpose the body can be formed with a cavity to increase the volume . Vessels moving in water,
are made using this principle.


**Centre of buoyancy**

The point where the up-thrust of a floating body acts is called the centre of buoyancy. This point
is situated at the geometrical centre of the portion immersed or the centre of gravity of the
displaced volume of the liquid.

Consider an instance when a pencil is dipped in water. The weight of the pencil acts at its centre
of gravity(G) while the upthrust acts at the centre of buoyancy (G1). Although _mg_ and _U_ are
equal in magnitude, they are not collinear as a result of which a moment is formed. Hence the
pencil will set horizontally.

If a ball of clay is attached at the end of the pencil it will begin to float vertically, the reason being
that because of the clay ball the centre of gravity of the pencil has shifted to a point below the
centre of buoyancy. Then due to the moment, the pencil would set vertical even if the pencil is
placed in an inclind position.

This can be used to compare the densities of liquids.
The depth that is immersed varies according to the density
of the liquid.



**Figure** 7.16



The pencil would immerse to a large depth in liquids of
low densities while it would immerse to a lesser depth in
liquids of high densities.


107


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


**Hydrometer**

The hydrometer can be introduced as a simple instrument that can be used to compare densities
of two liquids.

The Figure 7.20 shows the state of floatation of a hydrometer in a
liquid. The lower bulb loaded with lead lowers the centre of gravity to
make the hydrometer float vertically In order to obtain a high up-thrust
when floating in any liquid the bulb is constructed with a large volume.



The thin long stem increases the sensitivity of the instrument.



**Figure** 7.17





The gaps between consecutive markings of
the hydrometer scale are not equal to each
other (or scale is not linear). This is shown by
the following expression.For equilibrium of
floating hydrometer,



_m g_ = _(V + Ah) ρ g_

_m_
_V_  _Ah_
 []



( _m_ is the mass of
hydrometer)



**Figure** 7.18



Hence it is seen that there is no linear relation between _h_ and .


In this above expression _V_ is the volume of the bulb and the loaded bulb. _A_ is the area of
cross–section of the stem. _h_ is the height of the immersed portion of the stem.

**Chapter 08**


**Fluid dynamics**


Fluid dynamics is the study of the flow of fluids In order to identify the characteristic of fluid flow
the flow, of water from a tap can be considered. When the tap is opened slightly, as that the flow
takes place slowly. It is clearly seen that there is no turbulence nature among the water particles.
Such a flow is referred to as a streamline flow.


When the tap is fully opened allowing the water to flow fast the flow becomes disorderly and the
water particles do not travel along specific directions. Such a flow can be recognized and is
called a turbulent flow.


Considering its importance this chapter deals with streamline flow of fluids which can be introduced
as follows.


turbulent flow
streamline flow


**Figure** 8.1 **Figure** 8.2


**Steady floor**

In a fluid flow if the velocity of a fluid particle passing through any point does not change with time
the flow is called a steady or a continuous flow.

In a streamline flow the fluid flows as layers and hence is also known as lamina flow. Due to the
relative motion between these layers frictional forces come into play between them and these
frictional forces are known as viscous forces. In the study of the unit the effects due to viscous
forces are considered negligible.


**The streamline**

In a streamline flow, the line which indicates the path of a fluid particle is known as a streamline

The tangent drawn at a certain point on a streamline indicates the direction of motion of particles
passing through that point. Streamlines never intersect each other.


109


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


**Tube of flow**

The region through which flows a collection of streamlines is a tube of flow.


**Equation of continuity**

Consider the thinning of a tube of flow due to the streamlines getting closer to each other.

Let _v1_ be the speed of flow at the entrance of the tube where the area of cross- section is _A_ 1.



Volume of fluid entering the tube through area _A_ 1.

per unit time = _A1v1_









Since the flow is continuous, the volume of fluid flowing past the cross section _A_ 2 per unit is the
same. If _v_ 2 is the velocity of the fluid flowing past _A2,_

The volume of fluid emerging per unit time = _A2v2_
 _A1v1 = A2v2_


This equation which explains the variation of velocity of flow with the variation of cross section
of the tube of flow, is referred to as the equation of continuous flow or the equation of continuity.
There are many situations in which this equation is technically made use of.

For example, when spraying water from a rubber tube connected to a water tap, the mouth of
the tube is squeezed to reduce is cross section and increase the emerging velocity of water.

The shower in the bathroom and the insecticides sprayer are other devices which use this principle
to increase the speed of flow.


110


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


The diameters of water pipes leading from the water tank on top of a house down to the taps
gradually reduce in diameters in order to increase the speed of flow of the water.

Figure 8.5 shows a water pipe system consisting of two pipes with different cross sections
connected at a junction. The diameter of pipe A is 60 mm while that of B is 20 mm. If water
enters at A with a velocity of 0.2 m s [-1] and flows steadily through the pipe to emit from B, find the
emerging velocity of water at B.



According to equation of continuity.

When a fluid is subjected to pressure if its density remains unchanged, than the fluid is said to be
an incompressible fluid.

Although gases at rest are considered as compressible fluids, a gas flow can be considered
incompressible. Hence in fluid dynamics motions of liquids and gases are being explained.


**Bernoulli’s principle**

Well known Swiss scientist Johann Bernoulli put forward a principle on the flow of fluids which
comes to be known as Bernoulli’s principle.

He has shown that in a streamline flow, the useful work done by pressures on a unit volume of the
fluid is equal to the sum of the increase in its potential energy and the increase in kinetic energy.

Accordingly, Bernoulli’s equation can be obtained as follows.

Work = force x displacement

= pressure  area of crosssection  displacement

= pressure  volume

Work for a unit volume = pressure


Consider the streamline flow through a water pipe as shown in
Figure 8.7. Let _p1_ and _p2_ be the pressures at two places where
the areas of cross section _A_ 1 and _A_ 2 respectively.

Work done by pressure when a unit volume

Hence, the useful work done by pressure = _p1 – p2_
Potential energy = _mgh_

Also since the mass per unit volume of the fluid is the density ,
Increase of potential energy per unit volume  =    _gh_ 2 –  _gh_ 1

Thus, the increase of kinetic energy per unit volume =

Work done by the pressure = Increase potential energy + Increase of kinetic energy.

In accordance with the above equation, Bernoulli’s principle can be stated as follows.


112


_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


~~On any point along the same streamline of a steady flow of an incompressible~~
fluid of negligible viscosity, the sum of the pressure, the potential energy per unit

volume and the kinetic energy per unit volume is a constant.


Consider two places of different cross sections of same potential level along a streamline

**Figure** 8.8


We know from the equation of continuity that when the cross – section gets narrow the velocity
of flow increases. According to the above equation it is clear that when the speed increases the
pressure decreases. There are many occasions in which this result is utilized technologically. The
spray pumps, the shaping of the air plane wing, changing the direction of a moving ball by spinning
it are some examples.


**Spray tube**

As shown in Figure 8.9 (a) a tube A is placed vertically in a vessel containing water. When air is
blown over A by another end B, water rises in A to mix with the air and get sprayed. This is the
action of a spray pump. Figure 8.9(b) and Figure 8.9(c) shows spray pumps used for various
purposes.

_**G.C.E. (A/L) Physics**_ _**Resource Book - Unit -02**_


In the set up shown in 8.9 (a) the reason for water rising in it is the lowering of pressure at its
upper end below atmospheric pressure. This is due to the high velocity of air which is blown
above A across X. By applying Bernoulli principle form X to Y (which are in the same streamline)
a relationship between the rise of the water in the tube and the velocity of blow of air can be
obtained. In chemical spray pumps, paint sprayers and in service stations the action of the spray
pump is made use of.



**Worked example**
The vessel shown in the figure 8.10 contains a liquid of

X Y _[p][o]_ density1000 kg m [-3.] Find the velocity with which air should

be blown through tube B in order to make the liquid in

4 cm the tube A to rise by 4 cm to the top of tube A and spray

(the density of air can be taken as 1kg m [-3] ) it.

Y _[p][o]_









Solution :
Consider two points X and Y along a streamline in the
same horizontal plane. Let _p_ be the pressure at X and
_po_ the pressure at Y. As _v_ is the velocity of air at X and
zero is the velocity at Y,



_p_  1  _v_ 2  _p_ 0  0  _p_ 0  _p_  1  _v_ 2, where  is the density of the air **.**

Since the liquid in A is rising due to the pressure difference of _p_ and _[p]_ 0

 _[ v]_ _A_ _[ < v]_ _B_



Consider a ball which is spinning
clockwise and projected towards the right
with a velocity _v_ . The air passes with a
velocity _v_ towards the left relative to
the ball. The tangential velocity of the
rotating ball causes the velocity of air to
decrease at point A and to increase at
point



Hence according to Bernoulli’s principal, it can be shown that _pA > pB_ . As a result, when the
ball moves forward it gets deviated towards the low pressure region there by setting the ball
along a curved path.


**Construction of the wing of an airplane**

The shape of the cross- section of the wing of an airplane is so constructed that the air streams
passing across the wing flow as closer streamlines above the wing, but it is not so with the
streams passing below the wing.

Therefore,the speed of the air flow at A above the wing is greater than that at B. Thus the
pressure at A becomes less than the pressure at B and the excess pressure _p2 - p1_ creates an
up thrust on the wing

If _A_ is the surface area of the wings,

The upthrust = _A(p2 - p1_ )

If the above value exceeds the weight of the plane it will be lifted

By applying Bernoulli’s principle between two points such as A and C along the same streamline
the required equitation for the above expression can be obtained.

Many other phenomena occur according to Bernoulli’s principle. Some examples are,

Roofs of certain closed houses are blown off during gales.

When an express train passes through a station people standing by the side can get pulled towards
the train due to an unbalanced force. When a boat is moving fast in water, the fish on either side
of the boat experience an unbalanced force towards the boat and get pulled towards it. When a
wind is blowing a half closed door closes fully.

Balancing of a balloon by a stream of pressurized air and balancing of ping-pong balls in a stream
of water are some items displayed in exhibitions which can be explained by Bernoulli’s principle.

Figure 8.12 (a) shows a funnel attached to the end of a tube connected to a water tap. When a
ping-pong ball is placed close to the mouth of the inverted funnel through which water is flowing,
the ball stays there while rotating

Figure 8.12 (b) shows a balloon placed close to a stream of air coming from a compressor. The
stream gets thinner above the ball and the upward force created would bear the weight of the
balloon.

Figure 8.12 (c) shows a vertical stream of water formed in a thin tube and a ping- pong ball being
kept turning there. In the same way it can be explained the way of air circulation in mounds built
by termites.
